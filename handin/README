CS1951a - Final Project

NEWSFLASH 
by Aaron Behr (abehr) and Alex Hadik (ahadik)


Please refer to our report (html/writeup.html). Instructions for running the code are under the section "Using Newsflash".

In order to run our server, the following dependencies are required:
- Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org/)
- Tornado (http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/)

Both can be installed using pip. We apologize for any compatibility issues -- this project was developed on Mac and has not been thoroughly tested on Linux.
